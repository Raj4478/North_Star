<p>I<span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;"> have approximately 30 minutes before I wake my son up and sprint out the door for our morning walk. It was in the upper 90s this entire month in South Carolina. I refuse to miss our morning walk, so we get out early before it&rsquo;s unbearable. I also bring Leo; I don&rsquo;t want it to be too hot for him.</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">A week and a half ago, I set some goals for myself. Running a bakery business means sugar, sugar, and more sugar. I have always walked and tried my best to eat healthy, but I found myself skipping meals and trading them in for dessert. Instead of lunch, I&rsquo;d have a cup of coffee and pull a chocolate chip cookie from the freezer. My brain fog was bad, and I was feeling tired all the time. I&rsquo;m sure working late hours and early mornings didn&rsquo;t help, but I just felt so unhealthy. I didn&rsquo;t feel as strong as I needed to be.&nbsp;</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">My goals were to wake up early in the morning and stick to four miles, eat three healthy meals a day with healthy snacks, and avoid desserts instead of eating them as meals. My dessert now is fresh fruit or rice cakes and peanut butter. I&rsquo;m proud to say that I am on day ten of the follow-through and feeling good. I&rsquo;m proud of myself for making it this far (I&rsquo;ve attempted to be healthier for a while and kept making up excuses), and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m finally on a working routine. Ten days is a short period, but when you&rsquo;re trying to eat better and work out, it feels like an accomplishment. There&rsquo;s no turning back now!</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">This blog post will include many of the meals I ate throughout the week, a</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">s well as our morning walks. Maybe you need some motivation to get out and walk or eat a better meal, so hopefully, this can help! I have a lot of trips scheduled in the coming months, so we&rsquo;ll see how well I can stay on this healthy path.</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>

<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">I&rsquo;m lucky my son wakes up begging to go on morning walks. He first says it when I walk into his room to wake him up: &ldquo;Mama, eat, walk!&rdquo; I make him breakfast, which usually consists of toast or waffles, a muffin, half a banana, and fruit/veggie pouches.</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">Having him eat breakfast on the walk buys a bunch of entertainment time. I love that he&rsquo;s getting so much fresh air and being in nature for the first few hours of the day. I stash random objects like painted rocks, cars, flashcards, straws, or random items under the stroller to pull out when he gets antsy. I also play music for him if he seems bored, which, luckily, I don&rsquo;t have to do much. He loves yelling the flex justify-center colors of the cars that drive by, pointing at signs, and waving at any worker truck. This is such a good time in the morning for us to talk and for me to ask him many questions.</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>

<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">I went a few days without my phone last week. I had the screen of death and had to go to the Apple Store to have it fixed. That meant five hours of walking around Southpark Mall while they fixed my phone with a toddler. Thank goodness my mom tagged along with us. We did the Lego store (they had Legos to play with) and the outdoor playground (even though it was so hot!), and he scarfed down some Five Guys french fries.</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">I was finished at the mall with him at 6 pm.</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
<p><span class = "flex justify-center" style="flex justify-center color: #ecf0f1;">At 6 p.m., I had to head to the kitchen and start baking for the farmer&rsquo;s market the next day. I almost called to cancel it because I had nothing prepared, but I stuck with it and made a bunch of cookie dough, lemon cake, and sourdough cinnamon roll dough for the next morning. I get up at three on farmer&rsquo;s market mornings to bake everything fresh. After only a few hours, I managed to do pretty well with the preparation!</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>

I&rsquo;m motivated to feel better, and I think it&rsquo;s working so far! I&rsquo;ll have some fun recipes and trips coming up soon! I have a glamping trip coming up with Becca, I&rsquo;m going home to Iowa with my mom and the Iowa state fair, traveling to the beach at the end of the month, and in September, I&rsquo;m going to Europe! I can&rsquo;t wait to share everything with you! Glad to be back in the groove of blogging, too! 🙂</span class = "flex justify-center"></p>
